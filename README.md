# A custom UI for the foscam cameras

Motivatation:
* I receiving a Foscam camera as a gift 
* reviewing the skin and capabilities of the built-in UI and it doesn't allow me to use this camera online publicly the way I want
* The existing skin appears out-dated

* Objectives
** More modern, hipper looking UI (rounded corners and all the rest)
** Eliminate the need for a user/operator password to access UI


# TODO list
* github - basic directory structure 
* develop base HTML page
* create a constants.js (user/pwd/url ...)
* sketch UI
* develop camera interface (js)
* implement a Foscam Fl8918W implementation of the camera interface
